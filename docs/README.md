## Welcome
Welcome to the documentation for Mobile City!  
Mobile City is a shared-experience game platform for one to over a hundred players.  
Gameplay can be customized for murder mysteries, survival games, LARPs, and sandboxes.  
Players interact face-to-face and use their smartphones for clues, actions, and items.  
Mobile City comes with premade scenarios but you can modify them or create your own.
